<u><p style="text-align: right;">Briefcase, Shut</p></u>

Did you know you could see to the moon?
I looked hard and said for it to become alive.
It did! I saw it move to the side, hiding behind the branches of some old tree. With a sneering grimace, it said to never make a similar request again.

—

How do I even begin to unpack all of this? I am soup at the bottom of a bowl, I am money thrown on a counter in excitement, it has been twenty years, it has been always, it has been never. The radio plays on, where are you my love?
Weird, weird, weird dreams.
Drive your car into a lake.

—

Gifts from one who knows me well.

What a time that was, to be shooting arrows and lasers at the hearts of everyone who may be near. It was my birthday and we were in the basement again. The eyes of another reveal what may be hidden. Connective tissues grow into vast space. I am glad to know I was your favourite.

Though I have written of this before, it seems that I am bound to spin around to these endless moments. I have pain, I have Joy.

—

Deep in the city, I pass by a known corner and the thought of longing doesn’t arise. It is too far behind but an echo follows me underground. I walk beneath blue light.

These reminders serve no one and exist only to keep a web of lost relationships as the fabric of our society. At times, we have been lovers, siblings, rivals, parents, sworn enemies. We have been lost among swells of human emotion and buried by reality. We breathe and dance around the maypole.

Your nails have grown long since we last spoke, they click together menacingly. A breeze rolls by and carries the fluff of life along with it. This ventilated space supports our comfort. In a relative basement, air is welcome. In the basement of a relative, we are once again cousins.

—

I will feel much better once you are all dead.
Perhaps now I can rest, though some still survive.
Sit in the lobby, surrounded by the family of your lover.
I am less an addict today than I was in my youth.
Once a youth, twice a youth, and then the third time?
There is still hope for us both as I descend the escalator to such a large, glass-walled hall.
They say these people were First, I am excited to find a family second in a strange square staircase towards the back.
Come to see me.

—

Five Things I Know:

	1.	My body processes a wide variety of inputs.
	2.	I am controlled by my emotions in a particular moment.
	3.	I feel mistakes much more deeply than successes.
	4.	There are other people in the world who know only their own struggle.
	5.

—

I better be the only one wearing a jacket.
Will we even need to talk?
I look up and they are gone again.
Recognize the real urge and overcome it.
Has it been fifteen years, or has it been thirty?
Build, break and rock.
When asked politely, say no before saying why.
There are pleasure houses in Korea, you will do well there.
Say yes when asked to remove a manhole cover with a deer on it.
I am strong. 
Offered another addiction.
My weakness is my strength, see through a window two houses away.
Stop on a whim at first light.
Pictures are always moving around me.
Live your own life, slow dance.
Eric Jordan Baker

—

Late at night, work crews bore through sacred rock, oblivious to their destruction.
No one is here to shout, no one is here to protect the stone as it is gathered and removed from the place where it was laid down during some great upheaval.
Carted away, soon to be ground up into dust or thrown in some heap, no one can hear the secrets kept folded between the layers of some stupid rock.
I listen, but nothing is said to me.
I speak, but the only noise is your step.

—

It pains me to think of the possibility that we may never be more than we are in this moment, friends stranded by a gulf of self-consciousness. Let us yell it to the skies, you will always be a part of me, even if we never see one another again! You are mine and I am yours! 

I think of the ease of your laughter and your smile, as we pass small words etched in wood back and forth. What became of those days of walking and talking, of red garments and black, of expectations, of tension, of uncertainty?

They fade into nothing, mixed among one thousand other days and thoughts, and yet, as soon as we are near it seems as though we have never parted. I know not how to be a good friend, but I still wish to learn.

I can see the end, yet I am blind.

A box full of small bodies, ready for embalming.

You anticipate my return, I fear my departure.

There is a dimple in one of your cheeks.

Tonight, you dine with your mother and brother.

—

Dans la pluie, dans le froid, je suis pris par mes choix.
A l’abri, tu me souris, offrant moi pu de soucis.
Je refuse puis je dis, c’est si bien
Sous toute cette pluie.
Tu réponds, garde donc tes mots, je marche de toute façon.

—

The sweat on my brow reveals more than I may like.
Is it brought by exertion, embarrassment or heat?

Sont où là, ceux-là ou, où sont ceux-là.

I will need to get used to this feeling of being first, the ringing of glass in my ears.
From my seat I can see the flames jumping in the stove.

—

Chocolates of misery, shared among the disappointed.
A back-up plan should involve somewhere warm and dry.
This small house is caught between two bridges.
Sliding away, there’s just half a moon today.

Each time that we wake up together, each time that I don’t have a clue, is only another time, that I wish to be closer to you.

Though it may never suffice, a split through the ice, this morning you are older and isn’t it nice.

—

Postcards not sent to many deserving recipients.
I am drinking myself dry.
How can you know which lane to take until you’ve tried them all?
Driver, cut in here. I want to show everyone else my attitude.
Le vent pousse la porte.
There is blood from my hands on my shorts.
Is it the drink or the drug?

—

I only brag about that which was given to me.
Even the clouds have changed their tune.
Stop at the top of the hill.
Thank you for having me.
Tears of the giant
Grey lies between blue and green and brown.
In the distance, I can spot a grand lake.
It is such a thin layer.
My legs continued to carry me towards your smile, adorned with a mask of mystery.
As I step through a gate towards you, waiting, you brighten with untraceable recognition.
And yet the name on your chest is so very familiar, as is your essence.
I can say for certain we have not met in a stretch.
What has kept us apart?
How many others stepping though that gate do you recognize?
Once this was months, years, lifetimes of arduous journeying, now reduced to a leisurely afternoon.
At what cost does leisure come?
The river continues winding its way through the wild.
There is the unmistakable glint of human activity.
Is it just snow?
Someone has moved into my locker.
Bump, bump, and we have arrived somewhere else.
There are mirrors on the ground.

—

This morning my right half stayed in bed.
Angels were a popular theme.
The eyes of a hideous child may live forever.
True masterpieces walk along beside me.
Colours that exist only in digital reproductions.

—

I’ve always been a little heel-dragger.
Ask my Pa, he’ll surely tell ya.
Broken feet will surely fell ya.
A river’s shape is never fixed.
August berries swell like cherries.
Crushed beneath my meagre fingers.
Juices spread across my skin.
Pine cones crumble under foot.
An imposter bench is surrounded by crickets.
This one is beneath the hum of electric motors.
Trace clouds before a soaring bright moon.
Fuck my bonds of famed attachment.
Life is now, so thanks for asking.

While he speaks I walk right past
My spiral star bloom blast.

—

Ma vie, tu sais, n’est pas si compliquée.
Je lis, je fuis, et puis je suis parti.
Au bout, mes choux, un autre de mes destins.

When there is colour, be drab. When it is drab, be lively.

—

Why did I feel as though I was wearing socks? 
Why am I still mad at you?
Why did you feel the need to go so far away from me?
I chew on porcupine quills.
What will the dean think of our family?
Busy Life
I am of the door.
Am I teasing or making fun?

—

Fear the storm as clouds are gathering.
Take pleasure in crafts that reflect nothing of our natural life.
Make mention of the right to be ignored. 

My disease is affluence.
Just another malcontent
Speaking as an immigrant
I’ve Been this way before

Glaciers scrape on many rocks
Trace a line and then they stop
Rain keeps falling but it’s hot
The cliffs I saw aren’t real.

I took the long way home again
Couldn’t reach my other friend
They’re all asleep around the bend
At least I swam tonight.

My favourite merchant’s leaving
They can’t afford to live
Perhaps they’ll take me with them
I have so much to spend.

Three grins later, I see your dark lines.

—

My money’s in funds that will never mature
It was worthless before and now it is pure
I don’t want a cent, my name’s all I got
But it goes a long way so I borrow a lot.

—

I will never be the one to speak their voice aloud, I will never be the one to speak out.
But if I must I can become, just like us all a chosen one.
But if I must I can become a voice that’s heard a chosen one.

Hear, me, speak, now.

Creature of contrast, creature of conflict, creature of comfort, when will it be my turn to run and your turn to chase?

Do you too have a scar behind your knee? Yours is neater.

Thanks to a reminder, I finished my last morsel of deadly indifference.

Buddy lost his box, unless he left it behind.

You’re like the person that means the most to me.

I’m glad to be wearing shoes.

—

I lost but I learned
That I don’t have a word
If you meet my demands
I’ll give you this urn
And in it you’ll find
That there’s nothing behind
This veil we hold dear
The light’s gone, it’s clear.

This sound carries far
And with it I hear
What must be the stage
Now who is the star
That sings for us all 
Under clouds which we fear
There’s a castle for sale
It costs only your ear.

A skunk runs away
And threatens its smell
With a big bushy tail
But not much to tell
Except that they know
The trees shield our growth
And when they’re cut down
The darkness, an oath.

I move down the street
To give strangers space
Clear out your cars
And take home your hate
The S slips my tongue
It has once before
Ok, sure I lied
I’m just self-absorbed.

But at least I have learned
What it’s like to have lost
The skunk’s not alone
A shiver of frost
The sting is so real
My skin claims to feel
Is it a bee
Or is it a wasp?

—

My door is always open but there are no drinks in the fridge.
Meditate in this garbage can.
Return a favour.
What are the best seventy minutes of your life?
Something about a story.
Waste Treatment
You have such long antennae.
Even the leaves become monstrous.

—

Avis au paresseux.
Vous êtes parmi nous.
Ramasser vos circulaires et utiliser les bacs à déchets.
Vivre sans la roue.
Le travail d’équipe est une sorte de magie.
Cendriers sous couverts, trois chats noirs et blancs.
Nous sommes prêts à décharger.
Ça m’a coupé et je l’ai ressenti.
La sécurité n’est pas tout de ce qu’elle a de l’air.
Je te ferai crier, avec une douce tendresse.
Déménage d’un trou à un autre.
Bien sûr que tu serais un des seize attentifs.

—

Interlope.
Make trouble and flee.
Who will miss it when it is thrown away?
Certainly not me.

Just four words were.

Zig Zag Home

An old smell follows.

Step into my life.

Nylon Shorts

It is only a garment.
Walk morning and night.
How far is it to somewhere I’ve never been?
Closer than you think.
Approach from another direction.
Arrive at the same stump.
There’s a bridge I’ve never been to, but even that I’ve now crossed.
This shelter I have sat in.
Before the number two, on a blue background.
I thought the door may be locked.
You can hear frogs in the city, if you know where to go.
Treat me as one and I will act as one.
I want to do something different. 
Carve rivers where there weren’t any before.
Support this tree’s growth.
Back to the bleachers.
Find this large spike.
Contemplating violence.
Leave it for now.
Turn at every unfamiliar corner.
Peaches ripen in the hills.
To live in the early summer.

—

Au Bout de l’Ile.
Working on the railroad with a view of the hills.
That room is simply buzzing.
Someone stands outside the door.
I saw a box of light.

Wet paper and paint
I surely may faint
The life of a saint
Some unholy taint

Three Stars Each
Nature is hidden behind No Trespassing and Danger sings.
From where does danger come?
This exposed stone supports my sleep.

Something is charging me up.
Men shake hands while women hold their arms and drink wine.
We are really vampires.
Who the hell is Erica?
That table is in poor taste, wealthy caucasians eating over naval guns.
Did you bring your privilege card?
Man inspecting rock.
Granite Globe.

A second one fell from the same tree and I walked past.

Focus on your surroundings and the rest will follow. 
The ideal will never be.
Branches and leaves reach down to the water.
Watch the movement created in a tray.
We are lucky to find each other.
Listen to the night, there is music.
I am still beneath your lit window.

Nordic walking, afraid to leave a trace but fine to leave an impression.

I remember waking up with tape on my mouth.
Find affinity, release strife.
Push away comfort, embrace pain.
This will be the last time.
In case you didn’t know, you may as well learn.
Privacy is a thing of the past.
Do this for yourself, float.
I will throw it all away.

Padded chairs mark humanity’s decline.
The tiles have begun to move on their own.
Caught in a lie.
Tell me of your freedom.
The needle works through the fabric, stitching together tears.
Pivot Poppy, spin on a pin.
The guillotine sits waiting, looking for a friend.
Epithelial Cells

—

I’m so hungry, can’t you see?
Nearly starving, this isn’t me.
I’m so hungry, can you help?
A little flour, or even kelp.

My guts are twisting, round and round
My eyes are bulging, and then the sound
Of your bag, open, what’s inside?
Only a whistle, from which I shied.

From which I shied

Another descent, another laugh
Another supper, another bath
And now the love, I deeply need
Rejuvenation, so now I feed.

On mother’s milk and on the breast
Of many beasts, but not the chest
Spoils of war, of which we speak
Provide the meals, not to the meek.

Not to the meek

So I go hungry, but still I know
The urgent need, to which we go
Unite as one, forget about
Everything Else, Stop Bloodshed, Stop Drought.

Stop Bloodshed, Stop Drought.

—

Discouraged by dripping paint.
The space around me has changed.
Simple miscalculation, is one sleeve longer than the other or is one arm longer than the other?

Sometimes I am a bad pet owner
Twist and slip, I think I own her
A tryst, I lisp, another folder
Dust and mist upon their shoulders
Upon their shoulders
Upon their shoulders

Nothing will be said
Nothing will be said
Everything is known
Everything is known

Nothing will be said when you’re back at home
Nothing will be said when you’re back at home
You are all alone
Oily skin and bone
Living in a dome
Weaving by a cone
Symbiotic loan
Triple-pleated tone

My lost bus fare is waiting at home on a chair.

Pencil’s in the gutter.

—

Incentivize
I watch the day start while sitting on a can
The first touch of sun over a crop of stones
For many it is mere routine
The unmistakable pleasure of having been here before
Hundreds of colours in the sky, but only two which can be seen
An opalescent azure and a burnt orange
In a cabin by the stream
Even those colours fade
I struggle to force my interest
When reluctance is made so clear.

—

Never walk away from the gate, stay and wait.
Watch as the blades appear and fade.
They are there all the while.
Lakes and Rivers and Land.
This road leads not to Rome, but leaves a trail of exhaust much longer than its length.
Sever and I.
Suddenly, forests shift to fields.
Nay, they yield.
They are not fond of citrus.
Now we see the orderly rows of houses.
Golf carts must slow to a crawl.
Bypass your retail obligation.
I see the tip of an orange hat.
And what of the light on a distant island?
All of the pieces butchered *bzzzsw* as one fall off together.
Can’t we just ask?
It does not start well for some.

—

Arms like mine lift hatred in the air before throwing it to the ground.
A symbol from another age appears.
Candy dispensers sit enticingly full.
Three times I feel the spark of recognition, three times I walk by.
The approach of a closed door is novel. 
From even just the corner of an eye, I can make out a memory of you.
We didn’t know each other then, and we don’t know each other now.
Stop and speak to me for a moment.

—

All of the signs are backwards.
Dream-Me is just scraping by.
Bring the monsters with you.
What have I given?
What have I taken?

—

Fail to distract
Lie on your back
Seek out a map
Miss close contact

Sick, tired, hungry, weak, poor, lonely, and so much more. 

Sign up today!

—

Walk on your skin and drink from your skull, it’s a good life in the olden days.

Walk on your skin.

—

All of this started with clipping my nails.

—

A drink of bitter water, spirits arrive and leave on unscheduled trains. I hold seeds of different sizes in my hand to plant, to eat, and to revere. While we wait, darkness settles and the din slowly grows. They are gone and so am I.

—

Welcome Home
Follow different tracks through the forest
Arrows point to turkeys in the trees
Perched awkwardly
Try to fly
Light slowly lessens
For a brief moment you rest your head on my shoulder
Can we stay this way forever?
I am a snail on the wall.
Step back and see.

—

Spit in the Creek
Water is carried so far beyond our imagination. Could we even realize the outcomes that brought us here? We are split between our infinite being. This is the only word that I need to know: I.

—

Why do I no longer carry my pieces of silver?
I gave them away.

—

Porte sans poignée, que se cache t’il derrière tes carreaux?

And what may you know of a core?

Marble hall and little cupboard, this mosaic was laid long ago. Have we come this far only to find our simple embrace? Good word news is slung throughout the universe on this day of sadness and remembrance, but the only thing that I can hear is your whisper. I love you.

Bark peels away from this tree as its leaves filter the light. Further back, it was bounced between reflective panels to an unnatural angle of approach. Squirrels nest above, they seem very much at home. Maple and bench and bone.

I carry your ashes in my heart.

Four strikes of a bell sound.

There is a drummer on the corner adding rhythm to the world. I appreciate what you do.

—

Je ne veux pas que la tristesse vienne pour moi.

Reste heureuse.

On moins on est en sécurité, le léopard est parti de notre maison.

Je vais juste ouvrir la porte pour voir si Benway est là.
Elle n’est pas là.

<p style="text-align: center;">-----</p>

<u><p style="text-align: right;">Appendix: Handwritten Briefs</p></u>

A scribble for you
One dollar or two
Cows mostly go “moo”
J’me sens pas mal flou
Always misconstrue
Could I have a clue?
Feeling brand new
C’est dur, non c’est mou
Many among few
Destruction de tout
Eating rabbit stew
Absorbed by the blue.

—

To home now I head, without even a trace
Of the dread and despair, the fear often faced
Instead simple joy is my constant companion
Not only tonight but right through the canyon.

Between walls of rock to the left and the right
Your spirit is here, holding me tight
Past, it is future, and future is passed
May this day that we live be never the last.

My lungs take in air, quickly renewed
Gone are the fair, humbled, subdued
Balance of faith, hard work and a stone
Trust that you’re here as I’m not quite alone.

I have a simple belief that conditions have improved.
I look up and there is a hook.

On s’est croisé sur la rue du Centre.
Quel bonheur inattendu, mais je suis pressé.
Peut-être la prochaine fois on jasera plus.
Tu es déjà parti.

—

<u>Witch Smile</u>

Ride by me with focus
Destination in mind
Concentrated awareness
Of allure and aligned
Your head, it is covered
Your clothing is black
But it hangs on so lightly
Without even a tack
I am part of the background
A slow-moving blur
Until now, this connection
Causes fabrics to curl
Neither malice nor grace
Make up my design
I am happy to see you
And all your round lines

Glow, now glow

We keep right on going
Though never the same
Sharp pencil, I pick up
In the gutter, it lay
This paper was found
Not steps from my door
Folded so tightly
Blank space, nothing more
To fill up with words
Trying only to spell
How you came from the west
And had nothing to tell
Now I scratch till I bleed
To feed this real itch
Ration emotion
Hear only my pitch

Go, now go

—

I left the store without bandages and gave my last kopecks to the smiling musician, on one side of the bridge there was a giant face-down in the water with a visible wound on the back of his right ankle. I smiled and thought of art. Alain caught up to me and I called him by another name. He thrust a letter at me which quickly filled the space. It appears I am dead. Whenever I stop paying attention to my ball and to my body, everything starts to come apart. I try and feel the truth. It frightens me, so I obliterate the text and the white light, and tack on my own ending. Upon awaking, two shades are in the room and laugh at my fear.

—

<u>Autumn Blooms</u>

Some flowers think the sun shines still
Which it does, which it does
But its approach has changed, light arrives
Now from an angle unlike any other
Even at noon, at nine, at night
Some trees put out berries, hoping to draw
A crowd of onlookers and pickers
As witnesses to the season’s last performance
Its grand finale
Some places get the same sun all year round
The poor plants are unable to get their much
Needed rest, although they don’t seem to mind
Not everyone needs to hibernate.

—

<u>Just a Reflection</u>

The right words are eternal
We use them casually
Can I be that honest
Our daughter loves spaghetti

Two candles burn, one more
Brightly than another
Together they light up a room
Filled with life-supporting gas

Animal instinct controls me
At least it surrounds us all
To overcome order and passion
Survive, work, resist.

—

A link in my chain
She walks with a cane
If I may explain
This isn’t my pain

No sense of shame
Lay only the blame
With the weak and the lame
Their extravagant claim

A fine pint of ale
A short severed tail
Sent through the mail
By an old, long-dead snail

Two trips we must take
And then bake the cake
Celebrations we make
To forget some mistake.

—

<u>When Only a Recording Remains</u>

You speak clearly to me, in words I don’t understand. Already some have told of your story, of your flight and of your friends. Unknown time divides us to bring us together again. Our references meet on so many levels but split on countless others.
We see, although do we see the same?
We are, although are we the same?
The glow extends far beyond your physical limits and reaches out for all it can reach, radiating here, now, triggering reactions despite tremendous distance. How can I not help but feel for a creature who knows, but knows not?
As I know, but know not.

—

<u>Brothers</u>

Wait for nothing
On this cool dark night
Hours ago, I was to meet you
And now here I am alone
Next to me, you did stand
My friend, my love, my brother
So I left
The meal we were to eat
Long since eaten
Wait for nothing
Everything is in this moment
If I am not there
Go on without me.

—

<u>Storms</u>

I wish this moment would last forever
With you sitting next to me, offering thanks
For the love we shared
I mumble my gratitude in return and
We part ways, hugging for a second time
These years continue to be formative
I love you still
They say the prairies are flat, but that
You can see the storms coming from
Miles away
I hear the tremble in your voice I know
So well
I wonder if we will ever be alone together again
Storms rage inside of me, did you see them come?

—

<u>Underscore</u>

The waveform collapses, further reinforcing
	the nature of the World.
The question begs to be asked,
	Why can’t you fix it?
At night, I sleep in a tomb.
Ignoring the Problem that lies with me.
My time is mine alone.
Don’t make me share it with thee.
The work, there to be seen.
On this evening of eves.
I think I’m still <u>here</u>.
Has it always been so blatant, or have I not been paying attention?
All realities exist.
Just Plan.

—

J’ai choisi
<span style="float: right;">I just need a little time alone</span>
<u>L’autre</u>

Quand on roule dans la rue et on ne se reconnaît plus, c’est l’autre.
Quand je dépose ma tête mais le bruit continue, c’est l’autre.

Les choses évoluent.
Rockets go boom.
Take a moment, turn on the light.
	Is there such a thing as a pen?
	Recognize the signs.
	It’s the eleventh hour.
	Criminal thoughts.
	Do your laundry, hang it to dry.
	Call your sister, just to say hi.
	Speak the truth, say you no lies.
	Read a book, if only the sky.
Don’t lose focus.
What’s the true cost?
a seventh signals the end.
time is not limited, it is infinite.

Words

Words are like letters,
	written in a different life
		and then tucked away,
			just out of sight.

Sent, received, read, understood,
	at this point they don’t matter.
		We play it by ear,
			year after year.

On small bottom shelves
	and inside old books,
		reminders of another
			moment and place.

One voice rises, others subside,
	issuing cautions and strong warnings,
		to proceed is to do so
			at considerable risk.

Quiet sets in,
 it is night once again.
	Will the sun return?
		Do you want my pen or my hands?

All About Aurora

Work gloves slide on the dash of her company pickup
										truck.										
Steps out after a deep breath and makes for the
							convenience
Store door. Once inside, she circles for five, ten
							minutes of
Painstaking selection, settling finally on two
								pops,
Some snacks too. Up at the cash, they offer
						cigarettes of
A specific kind and she takes them graciously.
								Her urge
Already relenting, payment is given and a
								quick
Exit made. Outdoors briefly, the prevailing
								chaos
Of a busy street corner overwhelms liberty’s
								true
Reign. Back in the driver’s seat, she sips soda
							to calm down.
A can of Canada Dry Ginger Ale, and some of
									the
Snacks too, but she withholds from lighting a
							cigarette. I
finish my friendly exchange and walk on, leaving	
								her behind.

Distant Rumbles

Faraway times appear near
For the possibility exists today
We walk among skyscrapers
And we scrape the soil.

The flowers surround you
So close to your skin.

As youth, luck is all you have
Chance encounters generate life
One day at a time
Tomorrow is another world. (Away)

Words, spoke so clearly
Denote no contest.

As child, mentions are made
Of intentions, and actions, and more
We follow the example of others
And daydream as we please.

Light jumps towards us
Leaving its streak behind.

Before our arrival, long after we go
Push on, and sally ho!
Both directions send their sign
Which echoes back in both directions.

—

Whose turn is it today?
